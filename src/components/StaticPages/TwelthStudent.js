<h5>Class 12 is an important milestone in a student’s life.</h5> It is the year after which you go off to college and venture into adulthood. It is also the time when you start thinking about possible occupations that you could pursue. You may have a number of prospects to consider and analyze if you are a student from the science stream.

Particularly because career options after 12th science are not limited to technical fields alone. Besides the core science disciplines, you can look at courses in Commerce and Humanities as well. This multiplicity of alternatives may complicate the decision-making process. So, we have consolidated a list of different tracks to guide you towards your career goals! 


<h5>Why Science?</h5>
From science experiments to coding workshops in schools, STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) initiatives are at the forefront of the education conversation. But why is the teaching of science so important? It is prioritized because scientific thoughts, methods, and inquiry seep into our everyday decisions. Also, it is human nature to solve problems, whether they arise out of curiosity or necessity. And teaching and learning methods are integral to keeping the inquisitiveness alive. 

We can observe applications all around us. It is embodied in the systems of roads, lights, and other infrastructures designed by city planners and civil engineers, and the smartphone in our hand, which is a marvel of computer engineering. Scientific processes are inherent in the trees that turn sunlight into stored energy and produce oxygen, and also in our own internal biology and bodily functions. 

Therefore, science is much more than memorization of facts, theory, and formulas. It is up to the educators to make young learners think about science as more than an academic discipline. In the classrooms, science should be portrayed as something that helps them acquire skills and discover truths. This approach is key to creating an engaged student community. 

<h5>What To Do After 12th Science?</h5>
